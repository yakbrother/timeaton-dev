      <title>Job Searchin’ Blues</title>

      <description>Why is it so hard to find a job? I’ve applied for well over a hundred positions (through LinkedIn, Larajobs, Hacker News, friends, random openings, or just cold-writing to a startup CEO). I’ve gone through a number of interviews, but had very little luck.
I attribute this to several things: First, I have not applied or interviewed for a job in 17 years. I’m out of practice. It’s slowly coming back, but the IT interview process was quite a bit different almost two decades ago.</description>

      <title>Monoliths vs Side Projects</title>

      <description>For a while, I worked for a company with a massive monolithic repository. Actually, by the time I left, it was two repositories; whatever remained of the original code, some of it still PHP4, from a decade ago; and a Laravel project with all the new refactoring and new features.
Refactoring such a big program into Laravel was actually quite fun. My team often spent hours with huge sheets of paper drawing out new table designs and flowcharts.</description>

      <title>Goodbye, Hospital</title>

      <description>After hurting my leg, I’ve spent the last four months in the hospital with various complications after the initial surgery. It’s been a wild ride, with a lot of pain, boredom, and frustration.
As such, I’m happy to announce I’m finally going home this week! I’ll still be in a wheelchair, but it will be wonderful to be back in a familiar setting, mischievous cats and all. I’m setting up a new office in my main living space to cope with my limited mobility, and everything is working out so far.</description>

      <title>Allonz-Y: Basic CSS Typography</title>

      <description>Part of me appreciates Tailwind CSS. It’s easy to use, especially for layouts, but I think that “utility” approaches to CSS are a bit much sometimes. This is especially the case in rendering dynamic content - such as a blog or user-edited pages.
Even if I’m writing only static code, there really is nothing uglier than a long list of:
&amp;lt;p class=“text-base font-light leading-relaxed mt-0 mb-4 text-gray-400&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Paragraph one...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p class=“text-base font-light leading-relaxed mt-0 mb-4 text-gray-400&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Paragraph two.</description>

      <title>Learning Go (golang): First Update</title>
      <link>http://example.org/posts/learning-go-first-update/</link>

      <description>One of the problems I discovered since my last post is this: as a life-long programmer, it can be a little tough to learn a new language from scratch. After going through a few video tutorials on YouTube, Udemy, and ZTM, I leaned the basic types, syntax, and theory, but then I quickly tired of the projects. I actually wanted to argue about their structure, the same that I would do if I were planning a new feature at work.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Fullstack Developer with a strength in PHP and other backend tools. I&amp;rsquo;ve been programming all sorts of code since I was very young with my first Commodore 64, and that has translated into loving Laravel code and learning all kinds of new technology.
These days I&amp;rsquo;ve been more focused on teaching, consulting, and helping businesses grow.
Off the computer, I live in Paris (though I&amp;rsquo;m from the US) with my wife and two cats.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of typography and minimalist design, and this blog was built to reflect that, both on the visual and technical sides. Behind the scenes, I&amp;rsquo;m running Hugo as a static site generator with a custom theme I built, originally based around concepts I saw in the theme Tokiwa and a lot of rebuilding from scratch.
Hugo is really fun to work with, and super fast when it comes to building and deploying.</description>

      <description>Download Resume
I&amp;rsquo;m a back-end developer with 16+ years of professional experience. I&amp;rsquo;m very passionate about writing and learning code; my main interest has been in Laravel, Terraform, static sites, and modern PHP/CSS. I&amp;rsquo;m always happy to learn something new.
I have a good understanding of front-end development, but what I really love is working behind the scenes. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked extensively with Github, adapating legacy code to modern standards, and finding the right tools for any job.</description>

      <title>Learning Go From a Hospital Bed</title>

      <description>I’ve always been fascinated by Go - mostly because I watched people work on it in co-working spaces and they always seemed to have fun with their jobs. But never learned it or used it in my work. I figured - I’m stuck in a hospital bed. Why not go for it now?
First took a quick look at jobs in my area that wanted Go programmers, and there no lack of listings.</description>

      <description>Hi folks! I’ve decided to add a blog to my site, mostly to write about my continued learning process as a programmer (and to keep myself accountable during the process). My plan is to write about my thought process as I code day-to-day, along with fun tips I find along the way.
There’s no go way to put it - this year didn’t have a wonderful start. I was laid off from a long-time job, and had a bone infection that landed me the in the hospital for nearly four months.</description>

      <title>Part-Job Found! Is it Time to Switch Careers?</title>

      <guid>http://example.org/posts/a-part-time-job-should-i-switch-carreers/</guid>
      <description>After about 9 months of looking - I found a job! It wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I thought I would be doing. Instead I&amp;rsquo;m no longer a code money, but a business teacher in Rennes, France.
It was a random recommendation from a neighbor (a programmer) who also teaches there, and my main subject is IT budgeting for full-stack developers. I&amp;rsquo;m the only American in the school, and the administrators like having their students learn with a native English speaker.</description>
