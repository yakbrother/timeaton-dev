I&amp;rsquo;ve been programming all sorts of code since I was very young with my first Commodore 64, and that has translated into loving Laravel code and learning all kinds of new technology.
Off the computer, I live in Paris (though I&amp;rsquo;m from the US) with my wife and two cats. I love to write songs and play music with friends, and I love to travel and meet difference kinds of people.</description></item><item><title>Colophon</title><link>http://example.org/colophon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 15:14:39 +1000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/colophon/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of typography and minimalist design, and this blog was built to reflect that, both on the visual and technical sides. Behind the scenes, I&amp;rsquo;m running Hugo as a static site generator with a custom theme I built, originally based around concepts I saw in the theme Tokiwa and a lot of rebuilding from scratch.
Hugo is really fun to work with, and super fast when it comes to building and deploying.</description></item><item><title>My Work</title><link>http://example.org/resume/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 15:14:39 +1000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/resume/</guid><description>Download Resume
I&amp;rsquo;m a back-end developer with 16+ years of professional experience. I&amp;rsquo;m very passionate about writing and learning code; my main interest has been in Laravel, Terraform, static sites, and modern PHP/CSS. I&amp;rsquo;m always happy to learn something new.
I have a good understanding of front-end development, but what I really love is working behind the scenes. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked extensively with Github, adapating legacy code to modern standards, and finding the right tools for any job.</description></item><item><title>Learning Go From a Hospital Bed</title><link>http://example.org/posts/learning-go-from-a-hospital-bed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 13:31:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/learning-go-from-a-hospital-bed/</guid><description>I’ve always been fascinated by Go - mostly because I watched people work on it in co-working spaces and they always seemed to have fun with their jobs. But never learned it or used it in my work. I figured - I’m stuck in a hospital bed. Why not go for it now?
First took a quick look at jobs in my area that wanted Go programmers, and there no lack of listings.</description></item><item><title>2023 So Far</title><link>http://example.org/posts/2023-so-far/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2023 23:11:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/2023-so-far/</guid><description>Hi folks! I’ve decided to add a blog to my site, mostly to write about my continued learning process as a programmer (and to keep myself accountable during the process). My plan is to write about my thought process as I code day-to-day, along with fun tips I find along the way.
There’s no go way to put it - this year didn’t have a wonderful start. I was laid off from a long-time job, and had a bone infection that landed me the in the hospital for nearly four months.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://example.org/uses/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/uses/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
