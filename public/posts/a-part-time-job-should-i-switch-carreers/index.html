Is it Time to Switch Careers?</a>
<span class=post-date>- 10 Oct, 2023</span></h2><p>After about 9 months of looking - I found a job! It wasn&rsquo;t what I thought I would be doing. Instead I&rsquo;m no longer a code money, but a business teacher in Rennes, France.</p><p>It was a random recommendation from a neighbor (a programmer) who also teaches there, and my main subject is IT budgeting for full-stack developers. I&rsquo;m the only American in the school, and the administrators like having their students learn with a native English speaker. The first day was absolutely terrifying - but now I&rsquo;ve tought three classes and I&rsquo;m getting the hang of it. I teach in English, but joke in French with them. Honestly it&rsquo;s really amazing to see light bulbs go on in someone&rsquo;s head when they understand or have an idea to contribute.</p><p>I&rsquo;m sure every teacher knows that feeling.</p><p>Alas, althought it pays well, it&rsquo;s only for one or two weeks a month. I&rsquo;ve been exploring alternatives. My last real job was Senior Director of Tech Operations in an international company. Originally I was looking backwards to becoming a fun-loving code monkey, but now I wonder if I could have better fullfilment as a full-time teacher, an Operations Manager, or something in Logistics.</p><p>There are two ways this could work: being a temporary consultant, or working full-time for a university or NGO, something that fits my ethics. As such, I&rsquo;m in the middle of changing my CV, LinkedIn, this website, etc. I have many friends in this area of work (mostly back in Geneva), so I think it maybe be a valid career change.</p><p>Career change. Is anything more scary? Don&rsquo;t say all the dinosaur bones in the museum coming to life to attack me, because I will never talk to you again.</p><p><strong><a href=/posts>&lt; Back to Blog</a></strong></p></article><footer><ul><li><a href=https://typo.social/@yakbrother>Mastodon</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/yakbrother>Github</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/yakbrother>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-eaton-pluies>LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=/index.xml>RSS</a></li><li><a href=mailto:tim@timeaton.dev>tim@timeaton.dev</a></li></ul><p>&copy; 2023 Tim Eaton | <a href=/colophon>Colophon</a> | Hugo | AWS</p></footer></div><div class=decoration></div></body></html>
