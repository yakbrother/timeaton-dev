    <p>One of the problems I discovered since <a href="/posts/learning-go-from-a-hospital-bed/">my last post</a> is this: as a life-long programmer, it can be a little tough to learn a new language from scratch. After going through a few video tutorials on YouTube, Udemy, and ZTM, I leaned the basic types, syntax, and theory, but then I quickly tired of the projects. I actually wanted to argue about their structure, the same that I would do if I were planning a new feature at work. Some tutorials just annoyed me.</p>
<p>Obviously I needed something new if I really wanted to learn.</p>
<p>So what were my big advances in working on PHP? From what I remember, they were almost entirely learned while watching people code at conferences or work. Seeing someone’s problem-solving process, or watching them make mistakes and then need to fix them or refactor their code, was a lot like my own process at home and it resonated.</p>
<h3 id="so-how-to-apply-that-with-go">So how to apply that with Go?</h3>
<p>I learned you could watch people code on Youtube and Switch. I started putting together a list of people to watch.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@rwxrob">@rwxrob</a> has quite a few videos, some quite advanced, but some excellent for beginners who want to jump into coding. He starts a bit slow, but I like watching his mind work as he codes larger projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GolangCafe">Golang Cafe</a> presents a series of problems and how they go about solving them; The Advent of Code is particularly good, but it looks like I could spend a lot of time here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_BzFbxG2za3bp5NRRRXJSw">@justforfunc</a> has a number of interesting looking videos to browse also - they’re a bit shorter and more targeted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are my start. I also found a <a href="https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests">repository on test-driven design with go</a>, and looking over that is helping me with a few questions I had.</p>
<p>Each of these begin to open their own set of doors, so&hellip; Time to buckle down and keep going!</p>
