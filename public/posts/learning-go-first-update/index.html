After going through a few video tutorials on YouTube, Udemy, and ZTM, I leaned the basic types, syntax, and theory, but then I quickly tired of the projects. I actually wanted to argue about their structure, the same that I would do if I were planning a new feature at work. Some tutorials just annoyed me.</p><p>Obviously I needed something new if I really wanted to learn.</p><p>So what were my big advances in working on PHP? From what I remember, they were almost entirely learned while watching people code at conferences or work. Seeing someone’s problem-solving process, or watching them make mistakes and then need to fix them or refactor their code, was a lot like my own process at home and it resonated.</p><h3 id=so-how-to-apply-that-with-go>So how to apply that with Go?</h3><p>I learned you could watch people code on Youtube and Switch. I started putting together a list of people to watch.</p><ul><li><p><a href=https://www.youtube.com/@rwxrob>@rwxrob</a> has quite a few videos, some quite advanced, but some excellent for beginners who want to jump into coding. He starts a bit slow, but I like watching his mind work as he codes larger projects.</p></li><li><p><a href=https://www.youtube.com/@GolangCafe>Golang Cafe</a> presents a series of problems and how they go about solving them; The Advent of Code is particularly good, but it looks like I could spend a lot of time here.</p></li><li><p><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_BzFbxG2za3bp5NRRRXJSw>@justforfunc</a> has a number of interesting looking videos to browse also - they’re a bit shorter and more targeted.</p></li></ul><p>These are my start. I also found a <a href=https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests>repository on test-driven design with go</a>, and looking over that is helping me with a few questions I had.</p><p>Each of these begin to open their own set of doors, so&mldr; Time to buckle down and keep going!</p></article></div></container></body></html>
