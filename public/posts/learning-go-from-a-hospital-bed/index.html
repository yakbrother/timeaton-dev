But never learned it or used it in my work. I figured - I’m stuck in a hospital bed. Why not go for it now?</p><p>First took a quick look at jobs in my area that wanted Go programmers, and there no lack of listings. It seems like many companies use it some way I took a day to read a few other people’s accounts of how they got into program, and came up with a synthesised plan of I would go about it.</p><p>My personal study method is to watch videos, typically at higher speed, which for some reason helps me retain information. I do like books as references, and articles for inspiration, so I found a few and added them to my notes to read later.</p><p>I started with some of the early talks from one of the writers of Go, Rob Pike. Here’s him talking about why they started the language: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXV7sa4oM4I">The Go Programming Language and Environment</a>
And his apparently famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAAkCSZUG1c">Go Proverbs</a></p><p>The man has some great blazers.</p><p>Next I bought a video course for half-off on Udemy called <a href=https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/>Learn How To Code: Google&rsquo;s Go (golang) Programming Language</a></p><p>I’ll report back after a few weeks of trying Go in various projects. I’d like to be able to write a few tools to put on Github for my portfolio, if it is as fun as everyone seems to think…</p></article></div></container></body></html>
