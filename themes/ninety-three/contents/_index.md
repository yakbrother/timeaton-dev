## Hi there!

I love figuring out systems, and I love working with people.

I've had many hats over the years - barista, cook, courier, PHP and Laravel programmer, dabbling in everything I've. Over the years I've used many kinds of technology, mostly involving Laravel, PHP, and MySQL recently. I've had plenty of forrays into Javascript, Python, etc, and I'm always looking for something new to learn. Recently this has changed into teaching and operations management. Always looking for the problems no one anticipates!

I also love to write about code. This page for thoughts that I have while working through projects in various languages.
