I'm a huge fan of typography and minimalist design, and this blog was built to reflect that, both on the visual and technical sides. Behind the scenes, I'm running [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator with a custom theme I built, originally based around concepts I saw in the theme [Tokiwa](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-tokiwa/) and a lot of rebuilding from scratch.

Hugo is really fun to work with, and _super_ fast when it comes to building and deploying. Best yet, it doesn't use any database or server-side code in production, so it's a lot less to worry about. I'd happily use it on other sites if many clients didn't require a dashboard or editing privileges.

The fonts I'm using are Bangers, Splice Sans Mono, and Karla (all available on Google). I use my own CSS for styling the site. The images may have a bit of editing using [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/).
