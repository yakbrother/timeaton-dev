## > Hi there!

I'm a web developer with many hats. Over the years I've used many kinds of technology, mostly involving Laravel, PHP, and MySQL recently. I've had plenty of forrays into Javascript, Python, Python, and I'm always looking for something new to learn. Recently that has been working on Go (golang).

I also love to write about code. This page for thoughts that I have while working through projects in various languages.

My inbox <a href="mailto:tim@timeaton.dev">is always open</a>! Feel free to check out my resume if you are looking for a developer currently.
