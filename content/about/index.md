I'm a Fullstack Developer with a strength in PHP and other backend tools. I've been programming all sorts of code since I was very young with my first Commodore 64, and that has translated into loving Laravel code and learning all kinds of new technology.

Off the computer, I live in Paris (though I'm from the US) with my wife and two cats. I love to write songs and play music with friends, and I love to travel and meet difference kinds of people.

If you're interested in working with me, I'd love to hear from you! You can see my full resume on the [Resume](/resume) page.
