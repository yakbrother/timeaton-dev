## Away from Work

To keep myself sane, I try to stay away from my laptop after work hours or on weekends, especially while I am traveling. I take an Ipad (2022 10.2in) during these times, so I can still read the news or play games. I take a Logitech K380 bluetooth keyboard for when writing inspiration hits; it's a lot easier than the keyboard on the screen and the keys feel solid and nice for typing.
